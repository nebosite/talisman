# Talisman on Electron

This is currently just a dream to make a cross-platform version of Talisman.   Electron appears to be the way to go, especially because as a WPF programmer I find the React/Typescript ecosystem is familiar and awesome.    

If you want to help, please drop me a note at ericjorg <(at)> thjcrew.net so we can collaborate.



## Starting Development
